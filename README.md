## About
Bring Home The Bacon is a simple game using no more than cursor movement and left mouse clicks.

Upon starting the game, a mask will fall over the office backdrop, giving the appearance of dark room and the cursor is a flashlight. 
Simply move the mouse around to try and find the hidden bacon. 
Once you have found a piece of bacon, click on it with the left mouse button, it will disappear, and another slice will be hidden elsewhere on the screen.
The tricky part is, you only have 20 seconds to find each strip, if you can't find the bacon in time, the game is over.

## Running
Once the folder has been unzipped, start the program by running main.py with your Python interpreter of choice.

Ex: `python main.py`
